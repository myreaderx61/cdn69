Hackers finally learned how to listen. \nResearchers at the National University of Singapore published a paper earlier this year detailing how, using only a smartphone microphone and a program they designed, a hacker can clone your key. What's more, if a thief was able to install malware on your smartphone, smartwatch, or smart doorbell to record the audio from afar, they wouldn't even need to be physically nearby to pull off the attack. \nThe key (ahem) to the attack, dubbed SpiKey, is the sound made by the lock pins as they move over a typical key's ridges.\n\"When a victim inserts a key into the door lock, an attacker walking by records the sound with a smartphone microphone,\" describes the paper written by Soundarya Ramesh, Harini Ramprasad, and Jun Han.\nWith that recording, the thief is able to use the time between the audible clicks to determine distance between the ridges along the key. Using this information, a bad actor could then compute and then produce a series of likely keys. \n\"[On] average, SpiKey is able to provide 5.10 candidate keys guaranteeing inclusion of the correct victim key from a total of 330,424 keys, with 3 candidate keys being the most frequent case,\" reads the study. \nIn other words, instead of fooling around with lock-picking tools, a thief could simply try a few pre-made keys and then stroll right through the victim's door. \nOf course, there are some limitations in the real world. For staters, the attacker would need to know what type of lock the victim has. That information can be figured out by simply looking at the exterior of the lock, though.\n\nSecond, the speed at which the key is placed into the lock is assumed to be constant. But the researchers have thought of that, too. \n\"This assumption may not always hold in [the] real-world, hence, we plan to explore the possibility of combining information across multiple insertions,\" they explain. \nIt's worth noting that at present this is a relatively easy attack to defeat. Simply make sure no one is around you, recording, when you put your key into a lock. However, that won't always be the case. \n\"We may exploit other approaches of collecting click sounds such as installing malware on a victim’s smartphone or smartwatch, or from door sensors that contain microphones to obtain a recording with higher signal-to-noise ratio,\" explain the study authors. \"We may also exploit long distance microphones to reduce suspicion. Furthermore, we may increase the scalability of SpiKey by installing one microphone in an office corridor and collect recordings for multiple doors.\"\nSEE ALSO: Police used ‘smart streetlights’ to surveil protesters, just as privacy groups warned\nIn other words, they're already thinking about ways to make this attack easier to pull off. And, sorry, so-called smart locks just present their own security issues. Amazon's Ring security cameras, remember, are hacked all the time. And as the researchers postulate, a hacker could, in theory, use the microphone embedded in such a camera to capture the sounds your key makes and then use the SpiKey technique to produce physical keys to your home. \nHowever, if a hacker got access to your Ring, there are easier ways to clone your key than listening to it. Even so, maybe make a little noise when unlocking your door going forward.

Rather than remove the tweet, Twitter will allow it to stand with some restrictions and a notice about how it violates the site's policies.\nWe placed a public interest notice on this Tweet for violating our Civic Integrity Policy for making misleading health claims that could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting. https://t.co/MA6E7mBpkm— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) August 23, 2020\n\nA follow-up tweet from Twitter Safety notes that the original tweet will be allowed to live on, just with limited engagements. That means no likes, no replies, and re-tweets without comment. It won't be deleted because most Trump tweets are considered relevant \"to ongoing public conversation\" by definition.\nSo now, anyone who looks at the newly flagged tweet will see a message sitting between it and the president's account info:\n\"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about civic and election integrity. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,\" the message reads, daring us not to laugh ruefully.\nWe're almost four years into this presidency and many have come to view Trump as a walking, talking, rage-filled manifestation of the \"old man yells at cloud\" meme. U.S. president or not, maybe it's time to re-think the old public interest rules. Eh, Twitter?\nThe company has taken an increasingly firm stance on Trump's social media behavior, which is to say multiple tweets emanating from the president's account have been flagged, but not removed, since May 2020.

Back in October he'd assured his followers of the same thing. So we'll see if the new sounds materialize. At least while you wait, you can make fart sounds inside your Tesla.\nAlso definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didn’t have an outside speaker until about a year ago.

Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 14, 2020\n\nThere's still no specific arrival time, but at least 2FA is apparently going through \"final validation.\" Let's hope those goat honks get validated promptly,

financial perspective. \nThe CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has become the world's fourth-richest person according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Only Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft's Bill Gates, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos are wealthier than him; Musk overtook LVMH's Bernard Arnault, who will now have to suffer the fate of only being the world's fifth-richest person. \nMusk's fortune increased sharply after the latest rally in Tesla stock, which closed on $1,650 Monday, close to a record high for the company. The Tesla stock pump on Monday alone boosted Musk's fortune by $7.8 billion; overall, Musk's fortune increased by $57.2 billion in 2020, according to Bloomberg's calculations. \nSEE ALSO: Elon Musk says smaller Cybertruck is 'highly likely'\nMusk's fortune is likely to increase by a lot in the near future, too. Based on premarket trading at writing time, Tesla stock is poised to open at $1,835 on Tuesday. And SpaceX, Bloomberg reports, is close to finalizing $2 billion in new funding, which would increase its valuation to $46 billion (the company was reportedly valued at $36 billion when it raised funding in February this year). Musk is a significant shareholder in both companies. \nCEOs and founders of major tech companies did well overall, with Bezos, Gates, and Zuckerberg all increasing their fortunes this year. Zuckerberg hit the $100 billion mark for the first time, and Bezos is getting close to becoming the first person ever to be worth more than $200 billion. Even Gates, who founded Microsoft but is no longer actively involved with the company, saw his fortune boosted to $114 billion according to Forbes. And Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly became a billionaire earlier this month, thanks to Apple stock's massive increase in price this year. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=2L1QUerpakfjZ96brhqadXat-FU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=r162jtbiHjytXZbbBs8PHs3eXvU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=pB1Nkk3WJWyWJdplviYN9dPa1ck=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=SzkhKN0XaDRphPsI4qh2G0QpSoA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Elon Musk is now the fourth richest person in the world","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=pB1Nkk3WJWyWJdplviYN9dPa1ck=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=Tb-wZVkquttGviL_4U2YdkGAMT8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=pB1Nkk3WJWyWJdplviYN9dPa1ck=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Elon Musk is now the fourth richest person in the world","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Dude's loaded.

The next update rolls out the following day, which will leave iPhone players functionally unable to play the game unless Epic and Apple settle their dispute.\nPlayers will earn points for surviving, eliminating others, and winning in the game's last-person-standing battle royale mode. Those points can be exchanged for an in-game costume of a shady-looking humanoid apple in a suit (subtle) and, for the top earners in each region, a \"Free Fortnite\" hat will be sent to their homes.\n\nAdditionally, the top 1,200 worldwide entrants will get a piece of non-Apple gaming hardware, ranging from all three current game consoles to the OnePlus 8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S7.\nEpic's money-maker has been MIA from the Apple ecosystem since last week. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after Epic introduced an in-game system to give money directly to the developers in exchange for discounted in-game currency. That process was a not-subtle way for Epic to bypass Apple's ability to skim 30 percent off all in-app purchases. Epic has since sued Apple.\nNeither Apple nor Google were amused, removing the game from their official mobile storefronts shortly thereafter. Android players can still get the game via Epic's website, but Apple devotees are out of luck until this gets resolved. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1459576%252F60097e2c-bd01-4cd6-a721-c47062469581.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=jvrgwT9fIx63pBQhMETs5MWKAVE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=0Bbf5dRx_DzQGpUeSxeyp94op20=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=xXEU-YREAUSav5ozavB-VUFZJlk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=Pzt0wiHpZndNm2KD0FOUTP5FsSM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Epic continues Apple feud by giving away Android devices in #FreeFortnite tournament","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=xXEU-YREAUSav5ozavB-VUFZJlk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=W-r8mYyXb1L_ba2surSH_VpiJrA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=xXEU-YREAUSav5ozavB-VUFZJlk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Epic continues Apple feud by giving away Android devices in #FreeFortnite tournament","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The petty battle rages on.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Epic continues Apple feud by giving away Android devices in #FreeFortnite tournament"}]

The president and his administration cite TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, as the reasoning behind its decision. According to the administration, there are cybersecurity concerns stemming from the company’s data privacy practices and the possibility of the Chinese government accessing TikTok’s data.\nThat reasoning plays a huge part in the lawsuit TikTok has filed today against the Trump administration. TikTok, in its complaint, accuses the Trump administration of having political, not security-related, intentions in banning the video app.\n“The executive order is not rooted in bona fide national security concerns,” reads a section of the suit highlighted by TikTok in its announcement. “Independent national security and information security experts have criticized the political nature of this executive order, and expressed doubt as to whether its stated national security objective is genuine…”\nTikTok recently launched a new website focused on debunking misinformation about the platform. The site highlights cybersecurity expert opinions that showcase that, at worst, TikTok’s privacy and data security issues are no more of a concern than those posed by Facebook and other U.S.-based social media platforms. \nHowever, it should be noted that the administration took similar action against the LGBTQ dating app, Grindr last year. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States successfully forced the app's Chinese owners to sell off Grindr over security issues.\nTrump’s TikTok order gave ByteDance until September to sell the app to a U.S. company if it wanted TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. That timeframe has since been extended by Trump until after the November election. Companies like Microsoft, Twitter, and Oracle have all expressed interest in buying TikTok. \nHowever, Trump has also openly talked about his wish that the U.S. government receive a cut of any TikTok acquisition. Experts have shared their confusion over Trump's payment request as no law exists facilitating such a thing.\n\"The President’s demands for payments have no relationship to any conceivable national security concern and serve only to underscore that Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs with the due process required by law,” the complaint continues.\nTikTok has voiced its intent to take action against the executive order for weeks now. Earlier, the company had put out a video assuring its creators that the app wasn’t going anywhere.\nNow that a lawsuit has been filed in federal court, the battle between TikTok and Trump has stepped up a considerable notch from when they were feuding over the president’s rally attendance back in June."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118500%252Fdcec80aa-5346-4bd0-a3e0-0c47758c5321.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=098mYmDdKkSmG_S7AZCTCTK-t0k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118500%252Fdcec80aa-5346-4bd0-a3e0-0c47758c5321.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=CdPtVsx7SbeDm_SKkUg_yzAtUoA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118500%252Fdcec80aa-5346-4bd0-a3e0-0c47758c5321.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=4xSWSmJlKYzqdxAqF9AcA_A3hDE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118500%252Fdcec80aa-5346-4bd0-a3e0-0c47758c5321.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=bCx459RcyVxBAPdS8VTeuOEiJwM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

To start, it's available on Polaroid's website for $99.99 with a 20-sheet printer cartridge costing $16.99 separately. You can also spend $129.99 for a starter set that comes with the printer and 40 sheets of paper. Other retailers, like Best Buy and Amazon, will have it on Sept. 10.\n\nSEE ALSO: For truly amazing Instagram photos, a point-and-shoot camera is a must\nIf Polaroid is to be believed, printing from the Hi-Print should be pretty simple. You connect to it via Bluetooth, choose and customize (with filters and text) what you want to print in an accompanying iOS or Android app, and let it rip. The images come out in the form of 2.3-inch by 3.4-inch wallet-friendly photos, but with adhesive backs so you can stick them wherever you please. Polaroid says printing takes less than a minute and claims the photos are water-resistant.\nThe battery is supposedly good for 20 prints before you need to charge it using a Micro-USB cable again. It looks tempting to just print the first 20 memes you find in your photo library, but remember it costs $17 to get more sheets. If you can restrain yourself and stomach the cost, Polaroid's new mobile printer could be a fun way to instantly decorate."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1465191%252F3ef2fd65-db55-45a2-8a66-12e65731c16f.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=zGLU_KcUHre6mT7koFXfBaecEHc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=wO643xJBxnv9BUuZ5-0H2fl-uM8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F356x205.png?signature=CEVlTCkIeLmklpiP1R5ytGQcv4s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F712x410.png?signature=e-BJ5nmwbvpW6iUhTW4L3WQ3Q9g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F280x157.png?signature=WiZ-PVYJ2kQ-D7EEFXRJtudWD1Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F560x314.png?signature=g6LTl-7BTQGS6N17X1Ze0SjblKE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Get printing.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-polaroid-mobile-printer-ios-android.png","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-polaroid-mobile-printer-ios-android.png","micro":1},"src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1465191%252F3ef2fd65-db55-45a2-8a66-12e65731c16f.png%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=dIc4KhVq3IUEyi_IBSuWkB7UKzk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1465191%252F3ef2fd65-db55-45a2-8a66-12e65731c16f.png%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=pM8FY3t2yfYsbzn0e9Ni1UGApuc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Get printing."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  polaroid"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Polaroid's new mobile printer turns your iPhone photos into stickers","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"That's not a rainbow-colored vape.

It appears that Samsung is either testing out different cooling designs for the Note, or perhaps shipping slightly different Notes depending on the market. \n\nIn any case, there's no reason to believe that the graphite thermal pad-based cooling is any worse (or better) than a vapor chamber design with heat pipes. It's an interesting anomaly that we don't often see on high-profiles phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. \nIt's worth noting that Samsung is still lining the phone's display with copper to disperse heat in the new Note; only the cooling underneath the motherboard was switched to graphite in the models iFixit tore down. \nAlso, iFixit has been tearing down the U.S. models with 5G mmWave tech. Things could be different in other variants and markets. \nSEE ALSO: Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live are surprisingly easy to repair\nOther interesting details: the wireless charging coils are very different on these two otherwise similar devices; the sheer size of the camera modules (they are very, very big); and the fact that the Notes only have two 5G modules apiece, whereas the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra have three (for reasons unclear). \nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra aren't very easy to repair. iFixit complains about the use of adhesive, as well as the battery and screen being difficult to replace. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118479%252Fa6566424-1ab3-4e41-9af9-98188861807d.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=XvUZj-AsMNr5ZgpSGQmoPJ2k9sE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118479%252Fa6566424-1ab3-4e41-9af9-98188861807d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=5dj6JVRRrFDokZw5EazSTbNy9aQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118479%252Fa6566424-1ab3-4e41-9af9-98188861807d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=gNFwSGbpjai1Y6oJ4dX8NSGybGo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118479%252Fa6566424-1ab3-4e41-9af9-98188861807d.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=Ur4ziguvqEpZnnjiGzllQ8RkXKQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

Users can once again start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars.\nZoom has become essential for schools and businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.\nSo it's a pretty big deal when the video conferencing service goes down like it did Monday morning.\nHey there! 👋 We have received reports of users being unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars. We are currently investigating and will provide updates as we have them. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. Please follow https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY.— Zoom (@zoom_us) August 24, 2020\n\nUsers around the world are reporting that Zoom is down. The outage appears to be affecting Zoom's video meetings and webinars. \nAccording to DownDetector, the outage is mostly affecting the U.S. The bulk of complaints about the downtime are located along the East Coast. (Disclosure: DownDetector and Mashable are both owned by the same parent company, Ziff Davis.)\n“We have received reports of users being unable to visit the Zoom website (zoom.us) and unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars,” says the company on its Zoom Status site, which updates users on service issues. “We are currently investigating and will provide updates as we have them.”\nZoom’s most recent update says it has “identified the issue” and is currently working on a fix.\nThe service has become extremely popular during the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, Zoom rolled out numerous updates to address data privacy and security issues.\nHoly Cow 🐮 @zoom_us is Down on a Super Busy Monday / we had a full calendar 📅 / guess Schools now have #ZoomDays added to #SnowDays pic.twitter.com/FsC7tCPqmg— J.

The year when companies started making high-tech masks with bone conduction technology built into them. Meet Vivzone's Bone Conduction Audio Mask.\nMake no mistake, this isn't one of those masks you can buy on Etsy. Created specifically for exercising, it's engineered with protection, leisure, and comfort in mind. It has an ultra-fine filter that functions to protect you from dust, bacteria, and other potentially harmful particles so you can breathe clean air, whether you're jogging, hiking, biking, or strolling.\nCheck it out:\n\nBut what really sets it apart from other masks is that it's also equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 technology to help you listen to music, pick up calls, and hear real-time navigation. Instead of in-ear buds, it uses a bone conduction speaker to free your ears and lessen direct harm to your eardrums. That way, you can enjoy your favorite playlists while you run, all while still being able to hear your surroundings. Like a car coming at you, for example.\nAs a totally unrelated bonus, sporting it will also make you look like you belong in Mortal Kombat. \nNormally $99, you can get this mask on sale for only $84.99.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Bone Conduction Audio Mask — $84.99\n              See

without all that oil by snagging a GoWISE USA® 8-in-1 programmable air fryer for $89.99, a $60 savings as of Aug. 24. \n\nNot to be a downer, but a lot of fun is bound to be canceled this coming fall and winter. Watching NFL games at bars? Nope. Celebrating Oktoberfest with thousands of drunken friends? We don't think so. Instead of dwelling on what could have been, maybe it's time for a backup plan.\nWatching TV and drinking beer at home will be a lot more fun with tasty snacks — and an air fryer is just the come-up you need in that department. If you've missed the air fryer movement over the past few years, an air fryer is a programmable appliance that allows you to make your favorite fried foods with much less oil than a deep fryer. You can make everything from chicken wings to fried zucchini, and feel much less guilty about indulging. And even if you're not concerned with the oil, you'll quickly get behind the crunchy-on-the-outside, juicy-on-the-inside results.\nSEE ALSO: Why you should get a deep fryer instead of an air fryer\nYou may be late to the air fryer movement, but the good news is that they've gotten more advanced and more affordable over time. This 8-in-1 Programmable Air Fryer from GOWISE USA, for example, is on sale for nearly $60 off, bringing the price to just $89.99. That's less than a weekend's tab at your local bar. \nThis particular air fryer packs eight modes, so it also roasts, toasts, grills, reheats, bakes, keeps warm, and dehydrates food in addition to frying. It's 4.6 quarts in size, so you won't be able to cook up wings for an entire party of friends, but we shouldn't be having large gatherings anyways, should we? The appliance itself is made of stainless steel and features non-stick surfaces for easy cleanup. \nIf we're not going out to bars this winter, we should at least make sure we have our favorite bar snacks on hand. And why not feel less greasy after eating them, too? Normally $149, the GoWISE USA® 8-in-1 Air Fryer is on sale for $89.99. \n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              GoWISE USA® 8-in-1 Programmable 4.6QT Stainless Electric Air Fryer — $89.99\n              See Details"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=89W4SxJ7M-EHnfwSaec42oft9ko=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=OBTfx2zoicM_Gl21E8rTD96MCOk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=b3UGTJbTnV4VlrzmZHFTax9cjA0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=CFGlvaIVVuC6Ecjn18PnULFb1hc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=CIfG9xpC8K85-z0B5CkI6lQH-5Y=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=mGd0GAlXTAkJSaEEoR4zxE8Sr5w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Make better snacks and save 40% off this programmable air fryer","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=b3UGTJbTnV4VlrzmZHFTax9cjA0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=duRmDfZUVeMv2gcHOcXHgjJOKM8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=eRq9-lKJIOJjR4PTbAMaRVeGbzY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=CIfG9xpC8K85-z0B5CkI6lQH-5Y=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118437%252F92280fe3-6de1-4334-b426-74388ba348b4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=b3UGTJbTnV4VlrzmZHFTax9cjA0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Make better snacks and save 40% off this programmable air fryer","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"buy_cta":[{"data-product-url":"https://zdcs.link/nnwdq","data-product-name":"GoWISE USA® 8-in-1 Programmable 4.6QT Stainless Electric Air Fryer — $89.99","data-product-img":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1459828%252Fc9efd490-b548-41f9-a18d-711fbe6fc535.jpg%252Ffit-in__675x0.jpg?signature=--h3VeGzLdZsM0NIiRVLVh0o-ZU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","data-product-img-credit":"gowise"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"If you can't go to the bar, bring the bar (snacks) home to you.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Make better snacks and save 40% off this programmable air fryer"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":54307}

Hackers finally learned how to listen. \nResearchers at the National University of Singapore published a paper earlier this year detailing how, using only a smartphone microphone and a program they designed, a hacker can clone your key. What's more, if a thief was able to install malware on your smartphone, smartwatch, or smart doorbell to record the audio from afar, they wouldn't even need to be physically nearby to pull off the attack. \nThe key (ahem) to the attack, dubbed SpiKey, is the sound made by the lock pins as they move over a typical key's ridges.\n\"When a victim inserts a key into the door lock, an attacker walking by records the sound with a smartphone microphone,\" describes the paper written by Soundarya Ramesh, Harini Ramprasad, and Jun Han.\nWith that recording, the thief is able to use the time between the audible clicks to determine distance between the ridges along the key. Using this information, a bad actor could then compute and then produce a series of likely keys. \n\"[On] average, SpiKey is able to provide 5.10 candidate keys guaranteeing inclusion of the correct victim key from a total of 330,424 keys, with 3 candidate keys being the most frequent case,\" reads the study. \nIn other words, instead of fooling around with lock-picking tools, a thief could simply try a few pre-made keys and then stroll right through the victim's door. \nOf course, there are some limitations in the real world. For staters, the attacker would need to know what type of lock the victim has. That information can be figured out by simply looking at the exterior of the lock, though.\n\nSecond, the speed at which the key is placed into the lock is assumed to be constant. But the researchers have thought of that, too. \n\"This assumption may not always hold in [the] real-world, hence, we plan to explore the possibility of combining information across multiple insertions,\" they explain. \nIt's worth noting that at present this is a relatively easy attack to defeat. Simply make sure no one is around you, recording, when you put your key into a lock. However, that won't always be the case. \n\"We may exploit other approaches of collecting click sounds such as installing malware on a victim’s smartphone or smartwatch, or from door sensors that contain microphones to obtain a recording with higher signal-to-noise ratio,\" explain the study authors. \"We may also exploit long distance microphones to reduce suspicion. Furthermore, we may increase the scalability of SpiKey by installing one microphone in an office corridor and collect recordings for multiple doors.\"\nSEE ALSO: Police used ‘smart streetlights’ to surveil protesters, just as privacy groups warned\nIn other words, they're already thinking about ways to make this attack easier to pull off. And, sorry, so-called smart locks just present their own security issues. Amazon's Ring security cameras, remember, are hacked all the time. And as the researchers postulate, a hacker could, in theory, use the microphone embedded in such a camera to capture the sounds your key makes and then use the SpiKey technique to produce physical keys to your home. \nHowever, if a hacker got access to your Ring, there are easier ways to clone your key than listening to it. Even so, maybe make a little noise when unlocking your door going forward.

Rather than remove the tweet, Twitter will allow it to stand with some restrictions and a notice about how it violates the site's policies.\nWe placed a public interest notice on this Tweet for violating our Civic Integrity Policy for making misleading health claims that could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting. https://t.co/MA6E7mBpkm— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) August 23, 2020\n\nA follow-up tweet from Twitter Safety notes that the original tweet will be allowed to live on, just with limited engagements. That means no likes, no replies, and re-tweets without comment. It won't be deleted because most Trump tweets are considered relevant \"to ongoing public conversation\" by definition.\nSo now, anyone who looks at the newly flagged tweet will see a message sitting between it and the president's account info:\n\"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about civic and election integrity. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,\" the message reads, daring us not to laugh ruefully.\nWe're almost four years into this presidency and many have come to view Trump as a walking, talking, rage-filled manifestation of the \"old man yells at cloud\" meme. U.S. president or not, maybe it's time to re-think the old public interest rules. Eh, Twitter?\nThe company has taken an increasingly firm stance on Trump's social media behavior, which is to say multiple tweets emanating from the president's account have been flagged, but not removed, since May 2020. The latest flag marks the second time in recent months that Trump's dishonest portrayal of U.S. elections specifically has drawn Twitter's (again, incredibly mild) wrath."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=JncKBS4jmruZ61E9rh29_j7Rl8E=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=QidmYtzOsrdOsCxoWE-rJcWY9b4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=riAvXwDWuzLNLAILdTnQWdkwiVc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=BkVrqHQqq9QLxQPayjNW1_BeXuo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=4rG38pbQqtCsyq-Hdutxz6CFi7U=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=Tby7M6DTvYn-JrpsFCwZvRB_RfE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Hey look, it's a day ending in 'y'!

Back in October he'd assured his followers of the same thing. So we'll see if the new sounds materialize. At least while you wait, you can make fart sounds inside your Tesla.\nAlso definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didn’t have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 14, 2020\n\nThere's also relief coming for drivers with a more serious update. Soon Teslas will notice bad roads with an automated detection feature. Musk said Tesla's autonomous system will label problem areas like big bumps or potholes. The label will prompt the car to automatically respond with a slow-down or steer-around move.\nYes! We’re labeling bumps & potholes, so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 14, 2020\n\nThen there's a Tesla feature that's been a long time coming: two-factor authentication for the Tesla app. You can start the car, unlock the doors, and even move the car to and from a parking spot all through the app. But that form of access is not very secure, since it only requires your Tesla app log-in info.\nSEE ALSO: Here's all the ways you can make your Tesla fart\nBack in April, Musk said the extra layer of protection through an SMS or authenticator code would be \"coming soon.\" On Friday, Musk gave a more detailed update and an apology about the \"embarrassingly late\" feature.\nSorry, this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 14, 2020\n\nThere's still no specific arrival time, but at least 2FA is apparently going through \"final validation.\" Let's hope those goat honks get validated promptly, too. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118193%252Fda25a6fc-c0b3-4289-b1cf-9dda3df2acf8.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=b_B_BYI-IEmJAvdoMCOMTqp1ZU0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118193%252Fda25a6fc-c0b3-4289-b1cf-9dda3df2acf8.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=40CHE0_zUQmadUOub2dpMaBUdzc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118193%252Fda25a6fc-c0b3-4289-b1cf-9dda3df2acf8.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=LXg0DPfWJfb9ANCBY-Ej_pJ8pMI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118193%252Fda25a6fc-c0b3-4289-b1cf-9dda3df2acf8.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=6Rbg02UQAXg6QipHj0-nGjV6xoI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

financial perspective. \nThe CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has become the world's fourth-richest person according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Only Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft's Bill Gates, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos are wealthier than him; Musk overtook LVMH's Bernard Arnault, who will now have to suffer the fate of only being the world's fifth-richest person. \nMusk's fortune increased sharply after the latest rally in Tesla stock, which closed on $1,650 Monday, close to a record high for the company. The Tesla stock pump on Monday alone boosted Musk's fortune by $7.8 billion; overall, Musk's fortune increased by $57.2 billion in 2020, according to Bloomberg's calculations. \nSEE ALSO: Elon Musk says smaller Cybertruck is 'highly likely'\nMusk's fortune is likely to increase by a lot in the near future, too. Based on premarket trading at writing time, Tesla stock is poised to open at $1,835 on Tuesday. And SpaceX, Bloomberg reports, is close to finalizing $2 billion in new funding, which would increase its valuation to $46 billion (the company was reportedly valued at $36 billion when it raised funding in February this year). Musk is a significant shareholder in both companies. \nCEOs and founders of major tech companies did well overall, with Bezos, Gates, and Zuckerberg all increasing their fortunes this year. Zuckerberg hit the $100 billion mark for the first time, and Bezos is getting close to becoming the first person ever to be worth more than $200 billion. Even Gates, who founded Microsoft but is no longer actively involved with the company, saw his fortune boosted to $114 billion according to Forbes. And Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly became a billionaire earlier this month, thanks to Apple stock's massive increase in price this year. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=2L1QUerpakfjZ96brhqadXat-FU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=r162jtbiHjytXZbbBs8PHs3eXvU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=kwUv0S7VxvNEOpm3HwXtpIQFJq8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=ZR__Og4mcWFjldTS2_2uQzx_7uc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Tm22xuNGrKJlHikR7O23MAyqv14=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=sO1MUHQ-GH7JUSld0W77I0pfR7M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Elon Musk is now the fourth richest person in the world","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=kwUv0S7VxvNEOpm3HwXtpIQFJq8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=XJzTBbEljiQA09Dry43-G70djsc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=BofsiQfMp2nEDY6WhAtn6girCPg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Tm22xuNGrKJlHikR7O23MAyqv14=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118246%252F25c40521-236e-4729-9a4d-0df267abad18.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=kwUv0S7VxvNEOpm3HwXtpIQFJq8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Elon Musk is now the fourth richest person in the world","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Dude's loaded.

The next update rolls out the following day, which will leave iPhone players functionally unable to play the game unless Epic and Apple settle their dispute.\nPlayers will earn points for surviving, eliminating others, and winning in the game's last-person-standing battle royale mode. Those points can be exchanged for an in-game costume of a shady-looking humanoid apple in a suit (subtle) and, for the top earners in each region, a \"Free Fortnite\" hat will be sent to their homes.\n\nAdditionally, the top 1,200 worldwide entrants will get a piece of non-Apple gaming hardware, ranging from all three current game consoles to the OnePlus 8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S7.\nEpic's money-maker has been MIA from the Apple ecosystem since last week. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after Epic introduced an in-game system to give money directly to the developers in exchange for discounted in-game currency. That process was a not-subtle way for Epic to bypass Apple's ability to skim 30 percent off all in-app purchases. Epic has since sued Apple.\nNeither Apple nor Google were amused, removing the game from their official mobile storefronts shortly thereafter. Android players can still get the game via Epic's website, but Apple devotees are out of luck until this gets resolved. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1459576%252F60097e2c-bd01-4cd6-a721-c47062469581.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=jvrgwT9fIx63pBQhMETs5MWKAVE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=0Bbf5dRx_DzQGpUeSxeyp94op20=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=MXLhCg3mBfwfqMew5NZVxhokIm0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=J4gulSH5lbxuodEq6kVc-qHqgxg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

iPhone recently, Apple has some good news for you.\nBloomberg reported Monday that folks who buy Apple hardware will be able to buy the AppleCare+ warranty package at any point in the following year. The previous limit was 60 days, but the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting warranty demand, per Bloomberg, hence the change.\nMashable reached out to Apple for confirmation of this policy change and will update this story if it responds. \nSEE ALSO: Apple's $699 Mac Pro wheels too pricey? These are much cheaper.\nAppleCare+ doesn't have a fixed price, instead shifting up or down depending on the device you want to protect. For instance, pay $129 for AppleCare+ for an iPhone 7 or 8, and you can get your screen repaired for just $29. That warranty plan goes up to $200 for the newest iPhones. It should be noted that AppleCare+ is an extension of the default one-year warranty that applies to all Apple products, and lasts 24 months. \nWhatever price you end up paying for your device, all that matters is that AppleCare+ is a little more freely available now. Try not to break your iPhone regardless, though."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=YdodPRi56cFrgvaDDKPWTl8wSuk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=piQmLgFzA1fWqfvWPGMIZS8w6Uc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=58BUWUvAYZaHy8bcY6O9MfRpc9o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=0mIzuqveWYvWPkWBKo0jLHcrwNY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ts_KnQQhfL6HvyuIBcC3bjVqwp8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=jDqYb1V4tMiqMVQxzvx6NLmBuRQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Apple now gives customers a full year to buy AppleCare+","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=58BUWUvAYZaHy8bcY6O9MfRpc9o=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=vi2x4U43CQyrcfSzJbzKV4i0dEY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=pnOgmrPg8THTzDEvgYh4-zJl7Fs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ts_KnQQhfL6HvyuIBcC3bjVqwp8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118253%252F4bcb439a-9de9-4688-8589-9defb20e7118.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=58BUWUvAYZaHy8bcY6O9MfRpc9o=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Apple now gives customers a full year to buy AppleCare+","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Good news if you're always dropping your phone.

Whether you're video chatting with friends and family, or taking some quarantine selfies (very guilty) for Instagram, that camera app is likely always running in the background.\nSo, when it comes to choosing a new smartphone, you want to make sure you're getting a device with solid imaging bona fides. I mean, looking our best in the digital realm is now just as important as in-person, so this decision can be a tough one. \nIf you're looking for the next best thing, there are really only three options to consider right now: Samsung's Galaxy S20 Ultra and the new Note 20 Ultra, and the iPhone 11 Pro.\nWhat makes these three phones so special? \nFor Samsung's S20 Ultra and Note 20 Ultra, it's all about the phones' impressive 108-megapixel rear-facing camera. There's also the company's Space Zoom feature to consider, which combines optic zoom technology with software-based, AI-powered digital zoom to give you paparazzi-like reach. \nWhile I'm not sure this latter feature will necessarily impact your decision either way, it's at least worth mentioning that the S20 Ultra allows you to zoom up to 100x on a subject, while the Note 20 Ultra offers up to 50x zoom. It sounds ridiculous in theory, but that zoom could come in handy — if you happen to be applying for a job as a paparazzo or maybe just want to spy on your noisy neighbors.\nThe iPhone 11 Pro, on the other hand, features three 12-megapixel lenses on its rear camera. And, while that doesn't seem as spectacular as what Samsung's managed with its latest flagships, Apple's hardware and software offer tons of on-device camera features to help enhance the quality of the shots.\nThe cameras on all three phones certainly sound impressive on paper, but specs alone can't tell you whether or not these sensors can deliver crisp and clear photos. So, I took the guesswork out of it for you. Seeing as how I now have the Note 20 Ultra, S20 Ultra, and iPhone 11 Pro in my possession, I figured I'd take some sample shots using all three to see if there are any notable differences. Here's what I found.\nDaytime shots\nThe Note 20 Ultra has a 108-megapixel wide-angle sensor that you can toggle on to provide you with a higher-resolution image. When disabled, it defaults to a 12-megapixel sensor instead.\nEssentially, you get better dynamic range (read: contrast) with the 12-megapixel camera, so it captures details like highlights and shadows better. But the 108-megapixel sensor gives you an image with more detail.\nHere's an example of an image taken using the 108-megapixel sensor on both Samsung phones:\n\nThe Note 20 Ultra delivered a super crisp and clear shot that doesn't look oversaturated in certain areas. Considering this is an issue I've had with the S20 Ultra, it was a pleasant surprise to see the colors were a lot more balanced overall.\n\nYou can see an example of that oversaturation in the photo above. While the plants look fairly similar in color to the Note 20 Ultra, you can see the biggest difference in the bricks, particularly in the background. On the S20 Ultra, they're not only sharper but also lighter in color.\nThen, there's the shot from the iPhone 11 Pro as seen below.\n\nIt looks a lot like the photo taken on the Note 20 Ultra, but certain subjects in the photo are a bit darker — like the pink hues on the flowers along with the brown tones on the flower pot, and the bricks on the right.\nAdditionally, here are some examples of ultra-wide-angle shots:\n\nIt's a lot easier to see that example of over-sharpening in the photos above and below. While the sky, clouds, and trees look really similar in color, the photo taken with the Note 20 Ultra looks a bit more washed out.\n\nMeanwhile, on the photo taken with the S20 Ultra, the colors look slightly artificial. There's a lot of saturation within the darker colors, which you can mainly see when looking at the shading on the bricks. \n\nAs usual, the iPhone 11 Pro produced a more true-to-life image that mostly mimics what you'd see in front of you.\nLowlight shots\nBoth the S20 Ultra and Note 20 Ultra have a Night mode feature for photos in low-light environments. It uses multi-frame processing to combine 30 images into a crisp shot. The iPhone's Night Mode works similarly, with sensors that analyze how much light is available to determine how long the shutter should be open.\n\nThe petals in the above Note 20 Ultra shot look a lot more realistic, whereas in the image taken by the S20 Ultra below, they seem way overprocessed. But the S20 Ultra did capture clearer results towards the bottom of the vase, which looks a lot sharper than on the Note 20.\n\nOverall though, both Samsung phones managed to do a better job at enhancing the brightness of the shot than Night mode did on the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nOf course, with the iPhone, it does leave more freedom for post-editing. Overall, I prefer the look achieved by the Note 20 Ultra. It's a vibrant image that doesn't look too overprocessed and feels a lot easier on the eyes.\nSpace Zoom\nBoth the S20 Ultra and Note 20 Ultra phones come with Samsung's Space Zoom feature. While I'm not sure why anyone would need 50x zoom (or 100x zoom), other than those who want to creep in on people's windows (or possibly their exes), I did test it out below. \n\nThere isn't that big of a difference between these two shots, but it's clear the lettering on the photo taken with the Note 20 Ultra appears clearer.\n\nI'll continue to test the feature for the full review of the Note 20 Ultra, but I anticipate that, as with both the S20 and the S20 Ultra, 30x zoom will be the sweet spot. When using both those phones, I found that images zoomed in at that exact level of magnification were the most impressive in terms of quality.\nAgain, I really don't find myself needing to use 50x zoom on anything. In a non-COVID world, I'd say this feature would probably be useful at concerts when you're not all that close to the headline act. However, since those aren't as common nowadays (there are unfortunate exceptions), you might not get much use out of it.\nLive Focus\nWith Samsung's Live Focus feature, you can adjust the blur in the background to allow for the subject to stand out more. The iPhone also has the same feature, but Apple calls it Portrait Mode.\n\nI actually laughed out loud at my first attempt at a Live Focus shot on the Note 20 Ultra because I realized I probably shouldn't have placed a clear straw in front of a window. So I'm not going to fault either of Samsung's phones for something that was clearly my mistake.\n\nAside from that, the shots look super similar in terms of sharpness and color. The copy on the sleeve does look a little too fuzzy for my liking on both, though. \n\nOkay, I'm definitely going to fault the iPhone 11 Pro for that straw situation. I mean, it looks like I photoshopped it out completely. I also want to point out the darker colors and shades in the shot above are a lot closer to what you would've seen in real life. \nThe iPhone 11 Pro shot also just looks a lot sharper and brighter all around, in comparison to the ones taken on Samsung's phones.\nThoughts, so far\nI'll have a much more in-depth review of the Note 20 Ultra soon, but for now, I'm extremely content with its camera setup. Its image processing offers a middle ground of sorts — shots appear more balanced and less oversaturated than they do on the S20 Ultra, so it's a lot easier on the eye. \nOf course, this does also come down to preference. If you're not a fan of even the slightest bit of saturation, then you might want to opt for the iPhone 11 Pro with its more realistic colors and post-editing options.\nFor now, I'd say the Note 20 Ultra would be my go-to pick of the three. It's capable of brightening all the right colors while still keeping a realistic element that doesn't look over-edited. \nThat said, I still have quite a bit of quality time to spend with the Note 20 — I've got plenty of selfies to take, some poses I've been practicing for Live Focus shots, and plenty of people to video chat with. So, we'll see if it does the job of fueling my narcissistic tendencies.\nWATCH: Here are all the devices Samsung announced at Galaxy Unpacked"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1450374%252F171ba6aa-8c96-4776-9722-5ec99312ff87.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=tlXoIM2sZmaiQRANTF37Umqwf7Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=qGrJ3OAO2PMb5rfAxoSG2FZbaFk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=9AjRCC0A1n-wv3Bnbcb7X2EUj5E=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=O6AArt9XP56nPZUH5TkFsrWQlno=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=cGGHuaQ9lGI0aw2EgFBOVr_PTqA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=cSkm8Mb1_j5RopW3KQ97BZbwpJo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"The phone camera is king and the Note 20 Ultra wears the crown…for now","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=9AjRCC0A1n-wv3Bnbcb7X2EUj5E=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=1IJ5W_5Ym8bwnqGQVxz6_IklrhQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=xznx_AiC20on3U5ZRQUQp29QFhg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=cGGHuaQ9lGI0aw2EgFBOVr_PTqA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117899%252Fc0a6d388-9b21-4876-acb2-672a310c3835.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=9AjRCC0A1n-wv3Bnbcb7X2EUj5E=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"The phone camera is king and the Note 20 Ultra wears the crown…for now","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"jznR4Nbxox","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"But what about the iPhone?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"The phone camera is king and the Note 20 Ultra wears the crown…for now"},{"_id":"5f3d2caa1b121c005e00005c","id":"/article/blackberry-5g-keyboard-2021/","title":"BlackBerry 5G smartphone with physical keyboard is coming next year","title_tag":null,"author":"Stan Schroeder","post_date":"2020-08-19T13:44:10+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:44:10 +0000","formatted_date":"08/19/2020","sort_key":"1K8syY","link":"https://mashable.com/article/blackberry-5g-keyboard-2021/","content":{"plain":"BlackBerry has risen from the ashes again.\nWhen BlackBerry Mobile's partnership with TCL ended in February, the brand's survival as a phone maker seemed in jeopardy. But now it has a partnership with OnwardMobility and Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile Limited.\nThe three companies announced Wednesday that they are releasing a 5G Blackberry phone with a physical keyboard. \nThere are no other details about this upcoming device, but the announcement points out that the emphasis will be on productivity and security. \n“BlackBerry smartphones are known for protecting communications, privacy, and data. This is an incredible opportunity for OnwardMobility to bring next-generation 5G devices to market with the backing of BlackBerry and FIH Mobile,\" Peter Franklin, CEO of OnwardMobility, said in a statement. \nYou may be forgiven for not knowing about OnwardMobility. It's a fairly new company that hasn't made headlines before the partnership with BlackBerry. The company was in stealth mode until recently. Franklin, its CEO, previously founded design and software development agency Infuse.us. \nAccording to the announcement, FIH Mobile will design and manufacture BlackBerry devices going forward, with OnwardMobility conducting product planning and market development. \nSEE ALSO: Google's 'Safe Folder' lets users set a PIN code to keep files away from prying eyes\nBlackBerry Mobile hasn't launched a new smartphone since 2018's Key2, which was alright for people who love physical keyboards on phones but far from perfect. Soon, we'll get a chance to see whether the world needs a 5G smartphone with a physical keyboard. \nThe new BlackBerry phone will be available in the first half of 2021 in North America and Europe. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1456104%252F40da7556-7a92-4dd5-91f5-990dcde3e2ea.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=uN1Ou8jtaLKn6V2dbxd2s9lEArM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=g74q9ItZzSlbxY6bcJKSWPVysoM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.png%252F356x205.png?signature=lCB_vKl1A4kQDkWyNuWc3avxaN4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.png%252F712x410.png?signature=WBpP5Ka1PE1S4aoubHz7YmZs5jQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.png%252F280x157.png?signature=ht6p_5gUg3hGUjOOvZl-3ZbFdKQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.png%252F560x314.png?signature=jTFYj7lSBGb8uFQeYgHHM4D8S3Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"BlackBerry 5G smartphone with physical keyboard is coming next year","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.png%252F356x205.png?signature=lCB_vKl1A4kQDkWyNuWc3avxaN4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=D8pqZzwmD7VaRzu35VG91Rrnr_8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=8ucB-DGgfBImzXswo8dlyNZp7og=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.png%252F280x157.png?signature=ht6p_5gUg3hGUjOOvZl-3ZbFdKQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118295%252Fd2581fcb-098f-48db-aa38-ffdd4df019cf.png%252F356x205.png?signature=lCB_vKl1A4kQDkWyNuWc3avxaN4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"BlackBerry 5G smartphone with physical keyboard is coming next year","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Aching for a 5G BlackBerry?

To start, it's available on Polaroid's website for $99.99 with a 20-sheet printer cartridge costing $16.99 separately. You can also spend $129.99 for a starter set that comes with the printer and 40 sheets of paper. Other retailers, like Best Buy and Amazon, will have it on Sept. 10.\n\nSEE ALSO: For truly amazing Instagram photos, a point-and-shoot camera is a must\nIf Polaroid is to be believed, printing from the Hi-Print should be pretty simple. You connect to it via Bluetooth, choose and customize (with filters and text) what you want to print in an accompanying iOS or Android app, and let it rip. The images come out in the form of 2.3-inch by 3.4-inch wallet-friendly photos, but with adhesive backs so you can stick them wherever you please. Polaroid says printing takes less than a minute and claims the photos are water-resistant.\nThe battery is supposedly good for 20 prints before you need to charge it using a Micro-USB cable again. It looks tempting to just print the first 20 memes you find in your photo library, but remember it costs $17 to get more sheets. If you can restrain yourself and stomach the cost, Polaroid's new mobile printer could be a fun way to instantly decorate."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1465191%252F3ef2fd65-db55-45a2-8a66-12e65731c16f.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=zGLU_KcUHre6mT7koFXfBaecEHc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=wO643xJBxnv9BUuZ5-0H2fl-uM8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F356x205.png?signature=CEVlTCkIeLmklpiP1R5ytGQcv4s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F712x410.png?signature=e-BJ5nmwbvpW6iUhTW4L3WQ3Q9g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F280x157.png?signature=WiZ-PVYJ2kQ-D7EEFXRJtudWD1Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F560x314.png?signature=g6LTl-7BTQGS6N17X1Ze0SjblKE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Polaroid's new mobile printer turns your iPhone photos into stickers","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F356x205.png?signature=CEVlTCkIeLmklpiP1R5ytGQcv4s=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=xm1OEPzmSmGAlfvjdsAi4lPjKsk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=itcZ6BNm7R-u5GOopVliKiMtZK8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F280x157.png?signature=WiZ-PVYJ2kQ-D7EEFXRJtudWD1Q=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F356x205.png?signature=CEVlTCkIeLmklpiP1R5ytGQcv4s=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Polaroid's new mobile printer turns your iPhone photos into stickers","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"That's not a rainbow-colored vape.

Users can once again start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars.\nZoom has become essential for schools and businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.\nSo it's a pretty big deal when the video conferencing service goes down like it did Monday morning.\nHey there! 👋 We have received reports of users being unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars. We are currently investigating and will provide updates as we have them. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. Please follow https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY.— Zoom (@zoom_us) August 24, 2020\n\nUsers around the world are reporting that Zoom is down. The outage appears to be affecting Zoom's video meetings and webinars. \nAccording to DownDetector, the outage is mostly affecting the U.S. The bulk of complaints about the downtime are located along the East Coast. (Disclosure: DownDetector and Mashable are both owned by the same parent company, Ziff Davis.)\n“We have received reports of users being unable to visit the Zoom website (zoom.us) and unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars,” says the company on its Zoom Status site, which updates users on service issues. “We are currently investigating and will provide updates as we have them.”\nZoom’s most recent update says it has “identified the issue” and is currently working on a fix.\nThe service has become extremely popular during the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, Zoom rolled out numerous updates to address data privacy and security issues.\nHoly Cow 🐮 @zoom_us is Down on a Super Busy Monday / we had a full calendar 📅 / guess Schools now have #ZoomDays added to #SnowDays pic.twitter.com/FsC7tCPqmg— J.

Rather than remove the tweet, Twitter will allow it to stand with some restrictions and a notice about how it violates the site's policies.\nWe placed a public interest notice on this Tweet for violating our Civic Integrity Policy for making misleading health claims that could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting. https://t.co/MA6E7mBpkm— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) August 23, 2020\n\nA follow-up tweet from Twitter Safety notes that the original tweet will be allowed to live on, just with limited engagements. That means no likes, no replies, and re-tweets without comment. It won't be deleted because most Trump tweets are considered relevant \"to ongoing public conversation\" by definition.\nSo now, anyone who looks at the newly flagged tweet will see a message sitting between it and the president's account info:\n\"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about civic and election integrity. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,\" the message reads, daring us not to laugh ruefully.\nWe're almost four years into this presidency and many have come to view Trump as a walking, talking, rage-filled manifestation of the \"old man yells at cloud\" meme. U.S. president or not, maybe it's time to re-think the old public interest rules. Eh, Twitter?\nThe company has taken an increasingly firm stance on Trump's social media behavior, which is to say multiple tweets emanating from the president's account have been flagged, but not removed, since May 2020. The latest flag marks the second time in recent months that Trump's dishonest portrayal of U.S. elections specifically has drawn Twitter's (again, incredibly mild) wrath."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=JncKBS4jmruZ61E9rh29_j7Rl8E=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=QidmYtzOsrdOsCxoWE-rJcWY9b4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=riAvXwDWuzLNLAILdTnQWdkwiVc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=BkVrqHQqq9QLxQPayjNW1_BeXuo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=4rG38pbQqtCsyq-Hdutxz6CFi7U=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=Tby7M6DTvYn-JrpsFCwZvRB_RfE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Hey look, it's a day ending in 'y'!

Unfortunately, it can so easily suck time, leaving you stressed and under pressure to get all your other tasks done. \nWe are here to help. We don't want your email inbox to get you down so we've broken down eight great ways to organize your Gmail set-up to improve your productivity. \nGetting started \nMany of the changes we're suggesting need to be actioned in your Gmail's \"Settings\" area. \nTo access your settings in a browser, tap on the cog-shaped icon at the top right-hand corner of your screen. \n\nThis will bring up your quick settings menu to the right of your screen. Click on the \"Sell all settings\" box to bring up the full-fat Gmail settings menu. \nSet up a reading pane \nA reading pane gives you a way to read emails alongside your standard inbox view. Many people find this makes it faster to read and reply to messages. You can select to see a reading pane below your inbox or to the right of your inbox. \nTo make these changes to your Gmail, head to your settings, then select the \"Inbox\" tab along the top of your screen. Now scroll down to see the \"Enable reading pane\" option. Check this and select where you'd like the pane to appear.\n\nRather than choose to have a permanent pane, you can also select an option that allows you to toggle between a split pane mode and your standard inbox view. To activate this option, select the \"No split\" option. \n\nThis adds an icon to the top right of your inbox that allows you to switch between seeing a preview pane below your inbox, or have a standard full inbox view. \nEnable desktop notifications for Gmail\nIf you're waiting for an important email to come through, or you just don't want to miss a message from your boss, we recommend enabling Gmail's desktop notifications. This means you can work away in another browser tab and not have to keep obsessively checking your inbox to see if it has refreshed. \nYou can turn on Gmail desktop notifications by heading to your settings, then scrolling down the \"General\" options to see your \"Desktop notifications\" area. \n\nClick to turn \"New mail notifications on.\" Now, you'll see a pop-up notification in the bottom right-hand side of your browser screen when a new email is delivered. \nActivate the unread message icon \nAlternatively, if you're dead set against desktop notifications, but want to keep an eye on the status of your inbox whilst working in other tabs, there is another solution. \nGo to Gmail Settings, then under the \"Advanced\" settings in the \"General\" menu, scroll down to see your \"Unread message icon\" options. \n\nIf you enable this, your Gmail favicon will show how many unread messages you have waiting for you as a teeny tiny number. \nCreate a group email list \nThis is a handy tool to really save you some serious time if you often email the same group of people. There is a way to set up a list of email addresses into one group that you can customize the name of. \nTo do this, you need to go to Google Contacts. Look at the left-hand side of the screen to find the \"Labels\" menu. Click on \"Create label\" and give it a name that is easy to remember. \n\nNow you can drag and drop contacts into that label from the list on the right. \n\nNow, when you're composing an email, start typing the name of the label you've created in the \"To\" field and you'll see your label pop up as a suggestion. Simply click on it to add the entire group as a recipient. \nCreate useful templates in Gmail\nIf you often email the same message, then you can save a ton of time by turning that basic missive into a template. You can create up to 50 Gmail templates that you can insert into the body of an email with just a few clicks. \nFirst, you need to enable your Gmail account to allow template creation. Go to your settings, then under the \"General\" tab, click on \"Advanced.\" Click to enable. \n\nHead back to your inbox, open a new compose pop-up, and type exactly what you'd like the template's text to be. Once you've finished, click the three dots \"More\" menu at the bottom right of your compose window. Land on \"Templates,\" then select to \"Save draft as template.\" \n\nNow you just need to give the template an easily recognizable name. To use your template, open a new compose email pop-up, click the three dots menu and \"Templates\" again, and select the name of your template from the next menu screen that appears. \n\nMake the most of email labels \nLabels are Gmail's version of creating folders in your inbox. To create a new label you need to look to the left of your Gmail inbox and scroll down until you can click the \"More\" option. Scroll down again and you'll see the option to \"Create new label.\"\n\nIf you click this you can give your label a name. You can also choose to \"nest\" additional labels under a main label, creating sub-labels. \n\nThis is a useful way of really micro-managing your Gmail labels. \n\nYou can also change the color of your Gmail labels to give you a better at-a-glance way of organizing your messages. To change the color, hover over the label you want to edit, then click the three dots menu that appears. \n\nClick \"Label color\" to change it to one of the pre-loaded options.\nThe easiest way to move an email to a label is to drag and drop it where you want it. Alternatively, if you're in the email, you can click the label-shaped icon towards the top of the screen to chose the label you want from a pop-up list. \n\nActivate Gmail keyboard shortcuts \nIf you're someone that uses keyboard shortcuts, then you'll be delighted to hear that Gmail has a comprehensive suite of such actions. In order to start using them, you need to activate them. \nGo to your settings, then under \"General\" scroll down to turn keyboard shortcuts on.\n\nTo see a full list of shortcuts that you can now use, take a look at Google's handy guide to all the shortcuts that currently work in the email service. \n\nUse Auto-Advance to speed through your inbox\nIf you receive a high volume of email that can be dealt with quickly, activating auto-advance is a great way to speedily work through your new emails. \nThis feature will automatically show you the next conversation instead of taking you back to your main inbox view after you delete, archive, or mute a conversation. \nTo activate this, head to your settings, then the \"Advanced\" tab under \"General\", and toggle it on. \n\nUpping your Gmail game \nNot all these tweaks will suit every user, but we hope you've discovered a few useful Gmail tricks that will ease your email burden. \nSimply changing how you view your Gmail by adding a reading pane might be the refresh you need to up your productivity. Others may find that taking a little time to create email templates saves them a ton of it in the long run. \nGood luck implementing any positive changes you choose to make and do try not to let your inbox stress you out. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1453171%252Fae5c81fc-c58b-4343-b59f-56b80573bbff.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=pAbSrB_4o0beYyokdMmKx5m8P1c=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ubThnIPHC-w4BL3A60iYbHirCBU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=8xgljXDLoc9AyOgL6RpXauGA_mU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=PDJYbSfqyvAIIkyJmd66xw9hCU8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=BS32SMxSZKHWrAsXH7Bvu0nKTl4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=jGSNrHG5P8F8nNnX9Dgd0ouROL8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"8 great ways to organize your Gmail inbox to improve productivity","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=8xgljXDLoc9AyOgL6RpXauGA_mU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=ByBA1dzqbu6wIgby4VMmX_HB-Gs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=DFN_MDQu2Ta9lMIoksd1zs2x2yo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=BS32SMxSZKHWrAsXH7Bvu0nKTl4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118230%252F66e5794e-cbf0-4858-9fda-519e8461a211.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=8xgljXDLoc9AyOgL6RpXauGA_mU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"8 great ways to organize your Gmail inbox to improve productivity","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Tweaks to help you work smarter, not harder.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"8 great ways to organize your Gmail inbox to improve productivity"},{"_id":"5f41173fd359ab003c000007","id":"/review/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review/","title":"Lenovo Chromebook Duet review: A solid choice for college students on a budget","title_tag":null,"author":"Alex Perry","post_date":"2020-08-22T13:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"08/22/2020","sort_key":"1K9xyw","link":"https://mashable.com/review/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review/","content":{"plain":"Everyone wishes they could have a MacBook for school, but not everyone has that kind of money lying around. The new Lenovo Chromebook Duet is, if nothing else, an eye-catching option for students operating on a tight budget.\nPriced at $289.99, the Chromebook Duet is essentially a basic ChromeOS (Google's simple operating system for Chromebooks) tablet that comes with a detachable keyboard and trackpad. Snap that sucker on and it turns into a laptop without any hassle. Of course, its low price point means that corners had to be cut along the way. \nIs the Chromebook Duet the perfect back-to-school companion or will it leave you jealous of your classmates' laptops? Keep on reading to find out.\nThe Good: Truly portable with a lasting battery\nUnder normal, non-pandemic circumstances, going to school means shuffling between a series of dreary classrooms where you sit for 45 to 90 minutes while, ideally, learning something. In other words, you're moving around a lot. So, you may not want your note-taking and homework machine to turn that process into a workout by being too big and heavy.\nIf that's the case, I have great news: The Chromebook Duet is basically unimpeachable by this metric. The 10.1-inch display is more befitting of a mid-sized tablet than a true laptop screen. And when you attach the included keyboard via magnetic connectors on the bottom side, that will only take up about 9.6-inches by 6.6-inches of desk real estate. It'll fit on those crummy little desks that are attached to lecture hall seats with no hassle.\n\nThe Chromebook Duet also weighs only about two pounds with the keyboard attached, so you won't be lugging around something unbearably heavy all day. Using it as just a tablet brings that number down to a single, solitary pound in weight. It might as well not exist at that point. More than anything else, the Chromebook Duet is portable. Whether you're hauling it from classroom to classroom, or from bedroom to living room, there's practically no labor involved.\nSpeaking of the keyboard, its small size is just about the only problem I have with it. My hands are on the bigger side, so occasionally it feels like they're being squished together while I type. That said, key presses feel satisfying and the keys are adequately spaced out so you're not jamming your finger onto seven of them at once in the middle of class. It's just noisy enough that incessant typing might bother the people sitting next to you, though.\nOne of the nicest things about the Chromebook Duet is the battery. You won't need to panic trying to find a power outlet between classes thanks to a 7,000mAh battery packed into the Duet. I used it as a primary work machine for a couple of days in the process of writing this review, and I didn't need to plug it in until about lunchtime on the second day. \n\nObviously, more intensive activities will drain it much more quickly. However, even with a decent amount of video chatting during one of those work days, the Chromebook Duet's battery didn't take a major hit. It's probably a safe assumption that some of you will be doing remote learning this fall, and as far as I can tell, the Chromebook Duet's battery should be more than up to the task.\nOh yeah, you can use it as a tablet, too. Take the keyboard off and it works fine, but somewhat unremarkably, as a touch device. The screen is plenty responsive, but since this is ChromeOS, you're locked to using the Chrome browser and Android versions of apps. While its tablet mode isn't terrible by any means, it does pale in comparison to the iPad, highlighting the Duet's biggest problem: performance. \nThe Bad: Mediocre performance with a flimsy build and a lack of ports\nIt bears repeating that the Chromebook Duet is just $289.99 with 64GB of storage. You only get 4GB of RAM, meaning this bad boy isn't going to like it if you try to do too many demanding things at once.\nI won't call the Chromebook Duet's general performance outright bad, but it is mediocre. You could do worse, but you could also do a lot better. Like a lot of cheap Chromebooks, doing tasks that require a bit more processing power than basic web browsing or word processing can make things a tad sluggish. If you've used a more expensive laptop or tablet, you know that they feel buttery smooth all the time. The Chromebook Duet, meanwhile, always feels like it's either driving exactly at the speed limit or just a few miles per hour below it.\nIn particular, I had a mildly headache-inducing time using Android apps instead of just doing everything through Chrome. A word of advice if someone hogs the TV in your dorm room or at your parents' house: Just stream through Chrome instead of using apps for individual services. Both YouTube and Disney+ took an eternity to spool up videos through their Play Store apps, but worked better through the browser. \nThat's a position every student finds themselves in eventually, but I wouldn't call this the greatest screen for watching movies. It's sharp and colorful enough, but the surface is pretty reflective. You're bound to catch the reflection of your lonely mug sitting in a dorm room as you catch up on your favorite shows every now and then. \nSetting up the Chromebook Duet as a laptop on a flat surface is more of an ordeal than it should be due to slightly flimsy construction. Unlike many Chromebook hybrids, this isn't a laptop that you flip around and turn into a tablet; it's a tablet that you attach to a keyboard. You have to use a bundled back cover that also connects magnetically as a kickstand to prop the screen up in laptop mode. If you don't do that, the screen will flop down to the desk because there isn't anything built-in to prop it up.\nI got used to this after a while, but it means you have to carry around three physical components instead of two just to use it as a laptop. The back cover doesn't really do much aside from provide a kickstand, unfortunately. \nThe last thing that drives home the point that this is really a tablet more than a laptop is that the Chromebook Duet has just one USB-C port. That's it. This is especially damning for students, many of whom need at least a USB flash drive to move schoolwork around between devices. If you specialize in photography or the like, you'll need to get a special adapter to use a microSD card. It's inconvenient, to say the least, especially compared to some of the other options out there.\n\nThe Competition\nThere are way too many Chromebooks out there to choose from, so I'll limit this section to a few recent ones I've looked at that students might be able to afford. \nThe closest one in price to the Duet is the HP Chromebook 15, released last year for $449.99. Pound-for-pound, I think it has everything a student could want. It's a traditional laptop instead of a hybrid, but the performance is noticeably better than the Chromebook Duet. Additionally, you get two USB-C ports, a USB type-A port, a microSD reader, and a headphone jack. I mean, come on. That's all you need for getting through a boring school day.\nIf you want to spend even more than that, Google's Pixelbook Go is one of my favorite Chromebooks and it starts at $649.99. Yeah, it's a lot, especially for a student. But it comes in a gorgeous pink color scheme if you want, with a cool, ridged underside that makes it fun to carry around. It's super light and breezy, performs like a dream, and has a pair of USB-C ports with a headphone jack. \nBut the truth is that neither of those alternatives can run with the Chromebook Duet in terms of pure value. \nThe Verdict\nLenovo's Chromebook Duet doesn't have top-of-the-line performance. It won't blow you away with a huge amount of RAM, and its utility as a school device can be limited by a lack of ports. But I can't discount how convenient it (mostly) is to carry this little guy around from place to place, whether it's on a college campus or throughout a house you'd probably rather leave if not for the pandemic.\nIt's so physically insubstantial and good enough at basic tasks that, for around $300, it's easy to recommend.

look-alike websites, FBI officials warn","title_tag":null,"author":"Jack Morse","post_date":"2020-08-22T00:40:20+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:40:20

weaponizing your typos. \nWith the U.S. presidential election fast approaching, people across the country are going online to get instructions for voting by mail, the location of their polling place, and other vital Election Day information that will help them exercise their right to vote. Now, according to a Department of Homeland Security bulletin obtained by Yahoo News, unknown actors are registering website domains that mimic national and state voter information sites with unknown ends. \nDubbed typosquatting, the idea is simple (if devious): A hacker registers a domain that is close enough to a real site, like yourbanknarne.com, and puts up a clone of yourbankname.com. The unsuspecting victim goes to the wrong site by mistake, and enters their personal banking information. In doing so, they have inadvertently handed the digital keys to their account to a hacker. \nThat same approach, directed at official election sites, could be used to sow confusion and discord on Election Day. \n\"The FBI between March and June 2020 identified suspicious typosquatting of U.S. state and federal election domains, according to recent FBI reporting from a collaborative source,\" Yahoo News reports the Aug. 11 bulletin as warning. \nDigital Shadows, a digital risk protection company, warned about a similar threat in October of 2019. Looking at websites related to the then-numerous candidates running for the Democratic Party nomination for the office of president, the company identified six sites that might infect visitors' computers with malware (it should perhaps go without saying, but, do not go to these websites):\n\n  tuls2020[.]com\n  joebinden[.]info\n  joebide[.]info\n  actbue[.]com\n  yung2020[.]com\n  joebidin[.]info\n\nAccording to the DHS bulletin, something similar may be happening in the lead-up to the election. \n\"These suspicious typosquatting domains may be used for advertising, credential harvesting, and other malicious purposes, such as phishing and influence operations,\" the bulletin warns. \"Users should pay close attention to the spelling of web addresses or websites that look trustworthy but may be close imitations of legitimate U.S. election websites.\"\nOf course, a look-alike site wouldn't need to infect anyone's computer with malware to do harm. Think of a webpage mocked up to look like an election website in a swing state. Something as simple as sending users in Democratic-leaning districts to the wrong polling places could potentially alter the election outcome. \nThis problem is compounded by the fact that many official election-related websites end in .com or .org, as opposed to .gov, allowing anyone to register similar domains. \nThankfully, this problem is relatively easily defeated — as long as you're paying attention. So, when the time comes to vote, take extra care to ensure the voting logistics information you're getting comes from an official government site. Our democracy will thank you. \nWATCH: How to recognize and avoid fake news"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1459931%252F304bbbdb-a3ef-43b4-addd-5232f57a4972.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=U6oKRn0vfsQDxtFc7ER5YGAEuHY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=TLXMyd7o1NEe6bD733HQEN89fsc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ADZj2yoen4Lpyhb98qNeXHtgawg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=RtKp8ncsgNYBY5_PXl_P808l5dw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=n7Nakwl_Q-zwMJXMoTKijPcYCYM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=uLtSdlhff0HbHWgjmPRrB0V7mfc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Someone is registering election look-alike websites, FBI officials warn","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ADZj2yoen4Lpyhb98qNeXHtgawg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=nlt_3zkW1tPwpeaVTrCDiuMf3A8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=Ub3Z-ppkkSMLgfAlx9Gi5Tebd-A=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=n7Nakwl_Q-zwMJXMoTKijPcYCYM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118445%252Ff717853c-9279-4756-9712-5292dee33b82.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ADZj2yoen4Lpyhb98qNeXHtgawg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Someone is registering election look-alike websites, FBI officials warn","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"kEoDrPxAnp","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The look-alike sites could be used to install malware, or spread misinformation about Election Day.

The next update rolls out the following day, which will leave iPhone players functionally unable to play the game unless Epic and Apple settle their dispute.\nPlayers will earn points for surviving, eliminating others, and winning in the game's last-person-standing battle royale mode. Those points can be exchanged for an in-game costume of a shady-looking humanoid apple in a suit (subtle) and, for the top earners in each region, a \"Free Fortnite\" hat will be sent to their homes.\n\nAdditionally, the top 1,200 worldwide entrants will get a piece of non-Apple gaming hardware, ranging from all three current game consoles to the OnePlus 8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S7.\nEpic's money-maker has been MIA from the Apple ecosystem since last week. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after Epic introduced an in-game system to give money directly to the developers in exchange for discounted in-game currency. That process was a not-subtle way for Epic to bypass Apple's ability to skim 30 percent off all in-app purchases. Epic has since sued Apple.\nNeither Apple nor Google were amused, removing the game from their official mobile storefronts shortly thereafter. Android players can still get the game via Epic's website, but Apple devotees are out of luck until this gets resolved. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1459576%252F60097e2c-bd01-4cd6-a721-c47062469581.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=jvrgwT9fIx63pBQhMETs5MWKAVE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=0Bbf5dRx_DzQGpUeSxeyp94op20=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=MXLhCg3mBfwfqMew5NZVxhokIm0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=J4gulSH5lbxuodEq6kVc-qHqgxg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=XQoeZPWQbHitthM3Vx9XAq7jEuE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=IOk0zlvRTTDHOS4zsSlae01mmIQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Epic continues Apple feud by giving away Android devices in #FreeFortnite tournament","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=MXLhCg3mBfwfqMew5NZVxhokIm0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=XARlTtZOaOXiqC-uBigaqoQQbdI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=ZzqZKgy4LhXyUxMTueyXdzzo4oE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=XQoeZPWQbHitthM3Vx9XAq7jEuE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118408%252F8c4ff456-e0c3-4f60-9c50-45130974700b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=MXLhCg3mBfwfqMew5NZVxhokIm0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Epic continues Apple feud by giving away Android devices in #FreeFortnite tournament","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The petty battle rages on.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Epic continues Apple feud by giving away Android devices in #FreeFortnite tournament"},{"_id":"5f3f79825ccbd8005400001c","id":"/article/facebook-classic-look-september/","title":"You'll have to switch to the new Facebook look in September","title_tag":null,"author":"Stan Schroeder","post_date":"2020-08-21T07:36:34+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:36:34 +0000","formatted_date":"08/21/2020","sort_key":"1K9agE","link":"https://mashable.com/article/facebook-classic-look-september/","content":{"plain":"In May, Facebook started offering a redesigned look, though everyone still had the option to switch back to the \"classic\" Facebook experience. \nNow, according to notices Facebook has started showing to users, as well as its help center, (via Engadget), it appears that the classic look is going away in September. \n\"We've updated how www.facebook.com looks. If you're using the new Facebook.com, you can switch back to the classic Facebook temporarily. Starting in September, everyone will have the new design,\" says Facebook's help center. \nThe notice that popped up on my screen on Thursday said the \"classic Facebook experience will no longer be available starting in September,\" and gave me the option to provide feedback on why I'd want to switch back. \nSEE ALSO: Facebook's new policy bans blackface and some Jewish stereotypes\nI actually switched to the new Facebook look as soon as it became available, as I ached to finally get the dark mode, but even though I've gotten used to it over time, it was not an easy transition (read my impressions here). Based on anecdotal feedback from my Facebook friends, many hated the new look so much that they immediately switched back, dark mode be damned. I expect to see a lot of angry comments in September. \n\nUnfortunately, even if you hate the new design, there probably isn't all that much you can do to keep the classic look. One thing you can do, though, is provide feedback on the redesign, by clicking the down arrow icon in the top right of Facebook, clicking Help & Support -> Report a Problem, and then reporting any issues or missing features in the new look. \nWATCH: How to concoct (and remember!) an insanely secure password"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1458206%252F13b7aa06-790a-4258-9187-1b2ac5b4c44e.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=_5WarwXGv40WljDlFM0HlP5mem0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=m583CsXi8i7YqWJCmetUGz-T278=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=XlgtIn24gOEUWCTf2r6vQL7cp54=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=ngFbc5xUq-9tnpKp76wrDY-OrQk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ChSe_tLYOsPeo3-XmZtpRS0dJK8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=7wbdta5eZD9K_ulT0BIYtoCHzpc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"You'll have to switch to the new Facebook look in September","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=XlgtIn24gOEUWCTf2r6vQL7cp54=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=LdAUr8GTcEwi4lqHzOhV-fq2c-c=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=y3K18FgdlZMuAGWqTR8uKoxTjHo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ChSe_tLYOsPeo3-XmZtpRS0dJK8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118397%252F8a66b4c7-2976-4bfa-b75d-4c950a78e7f1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=XlgtIn24gOEUWCTf2r6vQL7cp54=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"You'll have to switch to the new Facebook look in September","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"4bo23Yd30E","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Sorry.

This means that Uber and Lyft can continue to operate in California without changing the way they compensate drivers at least until the case winds its way through the Court of Appeals, scheduled to begin in October. \nLyft was protesting the employee reclassification mandate with a halt to ride-sharing services that was set to begin Thursday night. The Court of Appeals judge's ruling came just in the nick of time to put the kibosh on the blackout. \nUPDATE: Aug. 20, 2020, 5 p.m. EDT Lyft confirmed that ride-sharing in California will continue after the Court of Appeals granted a stay. Drivers and riders were updated that \"Rideshare is ON.\"\nIn a statement the company wrote, \"While we won’t have to suspend operations tonight, we do need to continue fighting for independence plus benefits for drivers.\"\nThe California legal case will continue for the next few months. Oral arguments from Lyft and Uber are scheduled for Oct. 13. \nThe original story is as follows.\n\nCome midnight tonight, Lyft drivers and passengers in California will have to look elsewhere for on-demand rides.\nThe San Francisco-based company announced Thursday its decision to stop all ride-hailing operations in the state as soon as this Friday. This decision will only affect riders and drivers in California. Bicycle, car rental, and e-scooter services will continue operating as usual through the Lyft app. Lyft said drivers and riders were notified about the suspension this morning.\nThe shutdown stems from a legal battle over employee classification. Lyft, along with ride-sharing competitor Uber, is fighting to keep its drivers classified as independent contractors without offering them benefits like sick pay and healthcare. A state law, known AB 5, forces app-based companies with a gig workforce to start treating workers as full-time employees. California filed a lawsuit against Lyft and Uber earlier this year which led to the current Aug. 20 deadline to comply with AB 5. \nIn a blog post, Lyft wrote about the potential consequences of reclassifying its employees: \"This change would also necessitate an overhaul of the entire business model — it’s not a switch that can be flipped overnight.\"\nUber hasn't officially notified its drivers and users about whether it's moving forward with an impending shutdown in the state, too. But on a recent New York magazine Pivot Schooled podcast episode, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi strongly indicated that the company was likely to suspend operations through at least November.\nBut don't despair CA! \"We're going to figure out a way to be in California. We want to be in California.\" @dkhos says Uber engineers are \"figuring out how we can rebuild this thing\" to be on an employer model. Warns there will be fewer drivers and higher-cost rides.— Sasha Lekach (@sashajol) August 19, 2020\n\nLyft is also framing its decision as the only option. \"We don’t want to suspend operations. We are going to keep up the fight for a benefits model that works for all drivers and our riders,\" the blog reads.\nSEE ALSO: Uber Eats can keep delivering in California if ride-sharing shuts down, for now\nLyft and Uber are backing a state ballot initiative, Prop. 22, that would keep drivers classified as independent workers with some limited benefits. \nTo protest the move, workers from the driver advocacy group Gig Workers Rising are organizing a rally at Uber headquarters in San Francisco this afternoon. A Gig Workers Rising press release noted that drivers plan to \"display a giant, 8 ft inflatable baby outside of Uber HQ to highlight how these ultra-wealthy corporations and their CEOs are choosing to act like petulant children, threatening to 'take their ball and go home' if they don’t get their way.\"\n\"This childish behavior is unacceptable,\" said Edan Alva, a driver with Gig Workers Rising."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1457951%252F87497cd5-30ee-4b67-8963-cc60706aff0f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=QPzUyv_etlb2SdPYU-mmYkTTlMU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=sAxhspdm1QgvLOEH_CBquNt2KZw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=BGnkjDPPeReB9vNDeNt8_9-JObI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=QQ1SqGcYpa1q1a8tqOJj-l8AK-o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=2pBf6g0afgL4nUkRiMX-VwKIbiE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=b-heQAlFdFKKOIIrt_sqNmomI90=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"UPDATED: After threat of shutdown, court gives Lyft more time","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=BGnkjDPPeReB9vNDeNt8_9-JObI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=7yL-_LO45g_NKsR0GXTsI7E3RjM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=HK4sG7odCrpdeeNwIdP0yOXBxJQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=2pBf6g0afgL4nUkRiMX-VwKIbiE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118375%252F86b055ba-1194-4014-8952-9125eff97f5d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=BGnkjDPPeReB9vNDeNt8_9-JObI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"UPDATED: After threat of shutdown, court gives Lyft more time","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Is Uber next?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"UPDATED: After threat of shutdown, court gives Lyft more time"}]
